## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Spring](https://react-spring.dev/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) - Design System
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

### What I learned

To have a proer guidance on how to do things the best way while using Next.js,
I based my project on [this example](https://github.com/vercel/app-playground/). From which I learned:

- The basic structure of a Next.js project
- They way Next.js allows to customize meta tags in the page head
- How to define a global stylesheet for Next.js projects
- How to customize MUI themes
- How to define custom styles for MUI components with the `sx` property
- How to handle different screen sizes with Material UI's `useMediaQuery` hook
- MUI uses `createContext`, which only works in Next.js
  [Client Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/context-in-server-component)
- Improve my understanding of React's useState and useEffect, the rendering
  lifecycle and its interaction when using timers.
- Usage of react-spring (and how amazing it is!).
- How to deploy a static Next.js app
- How to set up favicons in Next.js

### Continued development

- Areas that I want to continue be focusing on in future projects:
  - Theme customization to ease heavy changes in larger codebases.
  - Timers interaction with the useEffect hook.
